# NPC-Hunter
DataStructures FInal Project

Want to make a program that uses graphs to simulate a set of NPCs wandering from city to city in a list. Would have some sort of randomization so that they could potentially got to the same city twice in a row. Program exits when the user gives the command. Edges in the graph would have weights which translate to time that the 'NPC's would have to wait at that location. Goal is to hunt down one NPC from the list, randomly selected when the program is started. Can only see what NPC's are at the city you're at and "ask around" for who was there before you arrived.
